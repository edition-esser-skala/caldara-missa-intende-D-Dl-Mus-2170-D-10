  – & –   & vl     & The directives “T.”, “Vv.” etc. in vl 1/2 indicate
                     the beginning and end of segments where ob 1/2 should
                     play unison with the violins. Based on these directives,
                     the oboe parts of this edition have been assembled.
                     Nevertheless, the directives are retained in vl 1/2. \\

                     col Organo}. Here, the editor assumed that the violins
                     should play one octave higher than org.
                     Thus, bars 55–59, 61–66, 68, 76, 87, 89, 92–96, 98–103,
                     and 105 were emended to accomodate the violins’ range.

                     the \textit{Domine Deus, Agnus Dei} should be ommitted
                     (probably because the \textit{Benedictus}
                     is a parody of this movement; see below).

                     “Li stromenti si canta da le parti”. Accordingly, these
                     instruments were added by the editor. \\

                     of clno may be deduced from the manuscript. The pitches
                     have been largely reconstructed by the editor. \\
    & 17–53 & –    & In \B1, this movement is indicated by “NB Benedictus
                     vide pag: 19 in Gloria”. Since the corresponding movement
                     (i.\,e., \textit{Domine Deus, Agnus Dei}) contains no
                     alternate lyrics, these have been added by the editor. \\
