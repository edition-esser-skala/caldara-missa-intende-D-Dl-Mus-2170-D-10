  – & –   & vl     & The directives “T.”, “Vv.” etc. in vl 1/2 indicate
                     the beginning and end of segments where ob 1/2 should
                     play unison with the violins. Based on these directives,
                     the oboe parts of this edition have been assembled.
                     Nevertheless, the directives are retained in vl 1/2. \\

                     should play one octave higher than org.
                     Thus, bars 55–59, 61–66, 68, 76, 87, 89, 92–96, 98–103,
                     and 105 were emended to accomodate the violins’ range.
